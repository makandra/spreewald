    Then I should see "Kiwi"
    But I should not see "Cherry"

    Then I should not see "Kiwi"
      And I should not see "Cherry"

    When I switch to the colors_2 iframe
    Then I should see "Cherry"
    But I should not see "Kiwi"
    # Unfortunately, manual reset for next test is necessary

    But I should not see "Fruit"

    Then I should see "Kiwi" inside the 1st iframe
      And I should see "Cherry" inside the colors_2 iframe
      And I should see a table with the following rows inside the colors_1 iframe:
        | Color | Fruit |
        | Green | Kiwi  |
      And I should see a table with the following rows inside the 2nd iframe:
        | Color | Fruit  |
