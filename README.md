# Spreewald

Spreewald is a collection of useful steps for cucumber. Feel free to fork.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'spreewald'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spreewald

## Usage

Steps are grouped into a number of categories. You can pick and choose single categories by putting something like

    require 'spreewald/email_steps'

into your `support/env.rb`

Alternatively, you can require everything by doing

    require 'spreewald/all_steps'


## Waiting for page load

Spreewald's web steps are all aware that you might run them with a Selenium/Capybara webdriver, and wait for the browser to finish loading the page, if necessary.

This is done by rerunning any assertions until they suceed or a timeout is reached.

You can achieve this in your own steps by wrapping them inside a `patiently do` block, like

    Then /^I should see "([^\"]*)" in the HTML$/ do |text|
      patiently do
        page.body.should include(text)
      end
    end

## Steps

### development_steps.rb

Marks scenario as pending

* **Then it should work**

  Marks scenario as pending


* **Then debugger**

  Starts debugger


* **@slow**

  Waits 2 seconds after each step


* **@single**

### email_steps.rb



* **When I clear my e?mails**

  


* **Then (an|no) e?mail should have been sent with:**

  Example:

        And that mail should have the following lines in the body:
          """
          All of these lines
          need to be present
          """

        When it is 10 minutes later
        When it is a few hours earlier



### web_steps.rb

Most of cucumber-rails' original web steps plus a few of our own. 

Note that cucumber-rails deprecated all its steps quite a while ago with the following
deprecation notice. Decide for yourself whether you want to use them:

> This file was generated by Cucumber-Rails and is only here to get you a head start
> These step definitions are thin wrappers around the Capybara/Webrat API that lets you
> visit pages, interact with widgets and make assertions about page content.

> If you use these step definitions as basis for your features you will quickly end up
> with features that are:

> * Hard to maintain
> * Verbose to read

> A much better approach is to write your own higher level step definitions, following
> the advice in the following blog posts:

> * http://benmabey.com/2008/05/19/imperative-vs-declarative-scenarios-in-user-stories.html
> * http://dannorth.net/2011/01/31/whose-domain-is-it-anyway/
> * http://elabs.se/blog/15-you-re-cuking-it-wrong


* **When ... within (.*[^:])**

  You can append 'within [selector]' to any other web step
  Example:
  
        Then I should see "some text" within ".page_body"


* **Given I am on ...**

  


* **When I go to ...**

  


* **When I press "..."**

  


* **When I follow "..."**

  


* **When I fill in "..." (with|for) "..."**

  Fill in text field


* **When I fill in "..." (with|for) '...'**

  Fill in text field


* **When I select "..." from "..."**

  Select from select box


* **When I check "..."**

  Check a checkbox


* **When I uncheck "..."**

  Uncheck a checkbox


* **When I choose "..."**

  Select a radio button


* **When I attach the file "..." to "..."**

  


* **Then I should see "..."**

  Checks that some text appears on the page
  
  Note that this does not detect if the text might be hidden via CSS


* **Then I should see /([^/]*)/**

  Checks that a regexp appears on the page
  
  Note that this does not detect if the text might be hidden via CSS


* **Then I should not see "..."**

  


* **Then I should not see /([^/]*)/**

  


* **Then the "..." field( within ...)? should contain "..."**

  Checks that an input field contains some value (allowing * as wildcard character)


* **Then the "..." field( within ...)? should not contain "..."**

  


* **Then the "..." field should have the error "..."**

  checks that an input field was wrapped with a validation error


* **Then the "..." field should( not)? have an error**

  


* **Then the "..." field should have no error**

  


* **Then the radio button "..." should( not)? be (checked|selected)**

  


* **Then I should be on ...**

  


* **Then I should have the following query string:**

  Example:
  
        I should have the following query string:
          | locale        | de  |
          | currency_code | EUR |
  
  Succeeds when the URL contains the given "locale" and "currency_code" params


* **Then show me the page**

  Open the current Capybara page using the "launchy" gem


* **Then I should( not)? see a field "..."**

  checks for the existance of a input field (given its id or label)


* **Then I should( not)? see the (number|amount) ([\-\d,\.]+)( (.*?))?**

  Better way to test for a number of money amount than a `Then I should see`
  
  Checks that there is unexpected minus sign, decimal places etc.
  
  See [here](https://makandracards.com/makandra/1225-test-that-a-number-or-money-amount-is-shown-with-cucumber) for details


* **Then I should get a response with content-type "..."**

  Checks "Content-Type" HTTP header


* **Then I should get a download with filename "..."**

  Checks "Content-Disposition" HTTP header


* **Then "..." should be selected for "..."**

  Checks that a certain option is selected for a text field


* **Then nothing should be selected for "..."?**

  


* **Then "..." should( not)? be an option for "..."**

  Checks for the presence of an option in a select


* **Then I should see '([^']*)'**

  Like `Then I should see`, but with single instead of double quotes. In case the string contains quotes as well.


* **Then I should see "..." in the HTML**

  Check that the raw HTML contains a string


* **Then I should not see "..." in the HTML**

  


* **Then I should see an error**

  Checks that status code is 400..599


* **When I reload the page**

  


* **Then (the tag )?"..." should( not)? be visible**

  Checks that an element is actually visible, also considering styles
  Within a selenium test, the browser is asked whether the element is really visible
  In a non-selenium test, we only check for ".hidden", ".invisible" or "style: display:none"
  
  More details [here](https://makandracards.com/makandra/1049-capybara-check-that-a-page-element-is-hidden-via-css)


* **When I click on "..."**

  Click on some text that might not be a link


* **Then "..." should link to "..."/**

  Use this step to check external links.
  
  Example:
  
        Then "Sponsor" should link to "http://makandra.com"



* **Then I should (not )?see an element "..."**

  Example:
  
        Then I should see an element ".page .container"



* **Then I should get a text response**

  Checks that the result has content type text/plain


* **When I follow "..." inside any "..."**

  Click a link within an element matching the given selector. Will try to be clever
  and disregard elements that don't contain a matching link.

        When I follow "Read more" inside any ".text_snippet"



* **Then I should( not)? see "..." inside any "..."**

  


* **When I fill in "..." with "..." inside any "..."**

  


* **When I confirm the browser dialog**

  


* **When I cancel the browser dialog**

  


* **When I enter "..." into the browser dialog**

  


* **Then I should see in this order:?**

  Checks that these strings are rendered in the given order in a single line or in multiple lines
  
  Example:
  
        Then I should see in this order:
          | Alpha Group |
          | Augsburg    |
          | Berlin      |
          | Beta Group  |



* **Then the "..." (field|button) should( not)? be disabled**

  Tests that an input or button with the given label is disabled.


* **Then the "..." field should( not)? be visible**

  Tests that a field with the given label is visible.


* **When I wait for the page to load**

  Waits for the page to finish loading and AJAX requests to finish.

* **When I perform basic authentication as ".../..." and go to ...**

  Performs HTTP basic authentication with the given credentials and visits the given path.
